\chapter{Foreword}
The North County District was organized to provide a coordinated sports program for the youth of the Member Athletic Associations.  It is important that every Spiritual Director, Parish Representative, Sport Coordinator, Manager and Coach take time to review all the rules and regulations under this cover.  It is our hope that with your complete and necessary cooperation, this organization will create a better understanding of what we are trying to accomplish in servicing the youth within the North County District.  With this in mind, we hope to make every effort to continue to serve God's children in the true tradition of His will.
